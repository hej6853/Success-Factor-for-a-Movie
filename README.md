# Success Factors for a Movie
This project is about exploring and visualizing data in business analytics projects. 

My team focused on exploring and wrangling data with ***Python*** to discover interesting analysis questions -- ***"Which factors leads to successful movie?"***. We paid special attention to data visualization methods using ***Tableau*** and their overall place in data science and business analytics.

## Motivation
According to Forbes, an average of 708 films have been released over the past 20 years, but 80 percent of them are losing money. The box office revenue generated by the sale of movie tickets is one of the most important measurements of the film industry's commercial success. This result drove our team’s curiosity to ask the question ***'Then what is the secret of the 20 percent of movies that are profitable?, and in which factors lead to a more profitable movie?”*** Interest in predicting the success of individual films from a commercial perspective is increasing along with genre on the factors that determine the success of films. Although there are many standards in choosing a movie and many factors are complicatedly combined with the box office elements of the movie, our team focused on storytelling and genre among the elements that connect the audience and the movie. Therefore, this report analyzes the factors influencing film box office commercial success and the relationship between genres.
